                  <h2>About me</h2>
                  <p class="wrapper-content">Hi!, My name is Geert Heemskerk I'm 18 years old. I am currently on an intership at Competa IT located in Rijswijk, this is my second periode of intership (2 times half a year). I am still learning so much on this intership about new stuff like frameworks and methods, I am in my third year of school, that is also the last year of my MBO 4 Application developer education. After this education I probably go for an eduction simmular like the one i am doing right now. But I think I'm going towards an eduction that focusses on design or interaction with clients.</p>

                      <h2>Overall experience</h2>
                      <p class="wrapper-content">I am going to tell a short story about my overall experience with development. I worked on different projects on school and most of all at Competa IT. For example we worked on a project for HHS (Haagse Hoge School), we had to work with back-end kenyans, so we had to talk english and via slack. sometimes there were miscommunications and we had to solve them. I learned that you have to be patient to achieve goals. I had to learn new develop languages to achive the goals that needed to be achived! I'm very driven to learn new languages and participate in projects, questions?? contact me below!.</p>
